<p>Our records show that you have chosen to go paperless for Self Assessment, but as of 14th February you have not filed your tax return for the 2014 to 2015 tax year.</p>

<p>We understand that switching from paper to digital messages is a big change. As this is the first year we have sent online messages instead of letters and you have not yet filed your return, we are sending you a paper Notice to File.</p>

<p>You will have three months from the date on the form to file your return and pay any tax you owe for the tax year. If we do not receive your tax return by the deadline you will be charged penalties as set out in the paper Notice. Penalties will also be charged if your tax return is filed late for future tax years.</p>

<p>You can still file and pay online at any time - you don't need to wait for the filing deadline.</p>

<p>If you have already contacted HMRC to discuss missing the 31 January filing deadline, you should ignore this message. </p>
