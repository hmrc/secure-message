<h3>What you need to do</h3>
<p line-height: 1><strong>If you’ve not paid you need to pay now</strong>, otherwise we’ll pass your debt to our debt collection services to collect.
    You’ll continue to be charged interest on the amount due until you pay in full.
    You’ll also have to pay a 5% late payment penalty on any balance of tax still unpaid 30 days
    after the balancing payment due date. There may be legal costs if our debt collection services are used.</p>

<p><strong>If you've paid this in the last 2 weeks</strong>, thank you, you don’t need to do anything further.
    You can check any payment’s you have made have been received and view your latest balance by selecting
    ‘View your tax year overview’ within your online account.
    Please note payments can take 3 to 6 working days to show on your online account from date they are processed.</p>

<h3>Get help</h3>
<p>Contact HMRC if you can't pay the full amount or disagree with your tax bill.
    You may be able to pay in instalments, get more time to pay or appeal the tax bill.</p>
